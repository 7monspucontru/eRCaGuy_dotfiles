= bazel: =

time bazel build //...
time bazel query //...
time bazel test //...
bazel --version
bazel help
bazel help build

bazel --host_jvm_args=-Xmx10g build //... = set max java heap size to 10g then build everything; see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55190272/java-lang-outofmemoryerror-when-running-bazel-build/60572662#60572662

*****BEST BAZEL BUILD CMD*****
time bazel --host_jvm_args=-Xmx10g build //...; gs_alert = same as above but better: time the whole thing and do an alert sound (bell character sound) & pop-up notification to notify me when done

bazel test --test_output errors //... = log all errors (failed test results) to stdout; see: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bazel-discuss/2mJPklIaCeo; see also: `bazel help test` for other options!
bazel test --test_output summary //... = the default (doesn't show errors; just shows a summary)
bazel test --test_output all //... = prints ALL output to stdout, even for tests that pass!

*****BEST BAZEL TEST CMD (optionally add `--host_jvm_args=-Xmx10g` if needed too)*****
time bazel test --test_output=errors --test_arg=--gtest_color=yes //... = get color output in the tests!
