    /// \return         Description of return types. It may be an enum, with these

    ///                 - #ENUM_VALUE_2
    ///                 - #ENUM_VALUE_3
    my_enum_t myFunc(int var1, int var2, int* var3, int* var4)
    {
        // function implementation here
        
        my_enum_t error = ENUM_VALUE_1;
        
        // Check for NULL pointers
        if (!var3 || !var4)
        {
            // var3 or var4 are NULL pointers, which means they can't be dereferenced
            error = ENUM_VALUE_2;
            goto done;
        }

        if (something_else)
        {
            error = ENUM_VALUE_3;
            goto done;
        }

    done:
        return error;
    }

You may also use `@` instead of `\`:

    /// @brief          A brief one or two line description of the function.
    /// @param[in]      var1            Description of variable one, an input
    /// @param[in]      var2            Description of variable two, an input
    /// @param[out]     var3            Description of variable three, an output (usu. via a pointer
    ///                                 to a variable)
    /// @param[in,out]  var4            Description of variable four, an input/output (usu. via a
    ///                                 pointer) since its initial value is read and used, but then 
    ///                                 it is also updated by the function at some point
    /// @return         None
    void myFunc(int var1, int var2, int* var3, int* var4)
    {
        // function implementation here
    }

And here's this shorter version again now with `\` again instead of `@`:

    /// \brief          A brief one or two line description of the function.
    /// \param[in]      var1            Description of variable one, an input
    /// \param[in]      var2            Description of variable two, an input
    /// \param[out]     var3            Description of variable three, an output (usu. via a pointer
    ///                                 to a variable)
    /// \param[in,out]  var4            Description of variable four, an input/output (usu. via a
    ///                                 pointer) since its initial value is read and used, but then 
    ///                                 it is also updated by the function at some point
    /// \return         None
    void myFunc(int var1, int var2, int* var3, int* var4)
    {
        // function implementation here
    }


= bazel: =

1. See all Bazel commands here (ie: `bazel --[startup options] <cmd> --[cmd options]`): https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html#commands
2. See all Bazel options online here! https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html. Ex:
    1. To pass in Java Virtual Machine (JVM) options, such as heap size, as Bazel startup options: https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html#flag--host_jvm_args
        --host_jvm_args=<jvm_arg>
    2. To limit how many of your local CPUs Bazel can use. Note that HOST_CPUS here is probably (and usually is) 1/2 the number of cores you have. So, if gnome-system-monitor shows you have 8 cores, you may only have 4 CPUs.: https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html#flag--local_cpu_resources
        --local_cpu_resources=<an integer, or "HOST_CPUS", optionally followed by [-|*]<float>.> default: "HOST_CPUS"
        NB: THIS cpu resource limiter option above doesn't actually work very well! Frequently, even with it in-use, the CPU usage will still lock out at 100% for periods of many minutes at a time! To prevent this, just use the Linux `cpulimit` program in a separate terminal!:
            cpulimit -p <pid> -l 500 # limit your bazel build to 62.5% max CPU usage on an 8-core machine
        Read more about the above command in the "Limit CPU usage" section of this document down below.
    3. To limit local RAM usage: https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html#flag--local_ram_resources
         --local_ram_resources=<an integer, or "HOST_RAM", optionally followed by [-|*]<float>.> default: "HOST_RAM*.67"
    4. To disable remote caching: https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html#flag--remote_cache
        --remote_cache=""

bazel --host_jvm_args=-Xmx16g build //... = set max java heap size to 16g then build everything; see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55190272/java-lang-outofmemoryerror-when-running-bazel-build/60572662#60572662

*****BEST BAZEL BUILD CMD*****
time bazel --host_jvm_args=-Xmx16g build //...; gs_alert = same as above but better: time the whole thing and do an alert sound (bell character sound) & pop-up notification to notify me when done

bazel test --test_output errors //... = log all errors (failed test results) to stdout; see: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bazel-discuss/2mJPklIaCeo; see also: `bazel help test` for other options!
bazel test --test_output summary //... = the default (doesn't show errors; just shows a summary)
bazel test --test_output all //... = prints ALL output to stdout, even for tests that pass!

*****BEST BAZEL TEST CMD (optionally add `--host_jvm_args=-Xmx16g` if needed too)*****
time bazel test --test_output=errors --test_arg=--gtest_color=yes //... = get color output in the tests!

= git: = 

To delete a branch, there are actually **3 different branches to delete!**. Read more here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2003505/how-do-i-delete-a-git-branch-locally-and-remotely/23961231#23961231
1. Deleting a **local branch**:
    git branch --delete <branch>
    git branch -d <branch> # Shorter version
    git branch -D <branch> # Force-delete un-merged branches
2. Deleting a **remote branch**:
    git push origin --delete <branch>  # Git version 1.7.0 or newer
    git push origin -d <branch>        # Shorter version (Git 1.7.0 or newer)
    git push origin :<branch>          # Git versions older than 1.7.0
3. Deleting a **remote-tracking branch**:
    git branch --delete --remotes <remote>/<branch>
    git branch -dr <remote>/<branch> # Shorter <===
    -----
    git fetch <remote> --prune # Delete multiple obsolete remote-tracking branches
    git fetch <remote> -p      # Shorter

= Linux (General): = 

== Limit CPU usage: == 
Limit CPU usage of a process in Linux: https://linoxide.com/linux-how-to/limit-cpu-usage-processes-linux/; ex:
    cpulimit -p 3185 -l 40 = limit Process ID (PID) 3185 to 40% ***of 1 CPU*** max CPU usage; so, for a multi-core machine (ex: 8 cores), to get a total of 40% of all cores you would need to use 0.4*(100/core * 8 cores) = 0.4*800 = 320, like this:
    cpulimit -p 3185 -l 320 = limit PID 3185 to 320% out of 800% (on an 8-core machine) = 320/800 = 40% overall on an 8-core machine!
OR
    cpulimit -e vmware-vmx -l 40 = limit the process named "vmware-vmx" to 40% ***of 1 CPU*** max CPU usage
    cpulimit -e vmware-vmx -l 320 = limit PID 3185 to 320% out of 800% (on an 8-core machine) = 320/800 = 40% overall on an 8-core machine!
So, to limit to 80% on an 8-core machine, use 0.8*800 = 640, like this:
    cpulimit -p 3185 -l 640
Limit to 62.5% on an 8-core machine:
    cpulimit -p 3185 -l 500

This is very useful to limit your CPU usage being used by Bazel, for instance, when it is building for dozens of minutes, or even hours. Note that the Bazel build server JVM is usually just called "java", and can easily be viewed with `ps`, `top`, `htop`, or the `gnome-system-monitor` GUI (my preferred choice).

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install cpulimit
    # Start your bazel build in one terminal, then in a separate terminal, run the following.
    # Replace <pid> with the Process ID number for your bazel build server process (usually
    # just called "java" when you look at it with `ps`, `top`, `htop`, or `gnome-system-monitor`).
    cpulimit -p <pid> -l 500 # limit your bazel build to 62.5% max CPU usage on an 8-core machine

Leave the `cpulimit` process running as long as you want this limiting effect in place. You don't need to restart it each time you begin a new bazel build, as the bazel build server continues running in the background even after a build completes.
