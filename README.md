- A few helpful nuggets I like to put in my ~/.bashrc file, for example, as well as some scripts and other configuration files
- Most files contain comments with additional info, instructions, or helpful links to look at; otherwise
- If a readme exists in a subfolder, take a look at it too for more install help or other usage information
