# Install all scripts!
# - Edit this file manually, as desired, if you only want to install some scripts. 

# TODO: Have this script automatically install (by creating symlinks in ~/bin) all scripts herein!
# For the sake of making it super easy to find all custom scripts, prepend each symbolic link in ~/bin with 
# the user's initials, like this: "gs_myscript".

# Optional: this will be prepended to every symbolic link created in ~/bin in order to make it super easy to 
# find all of your custom scripts. I recommend you set it to your initials, followed by an underscore. Set it
# to "" to not prepend anything.
PREPEND_STR="gs_" # set to your initials
# PREPEND_STR="" # or use this one to use nothing
