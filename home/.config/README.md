This folder will contain important user application settings I wish to back up and share.

1. [../../useful_apps/README.md](../../useful_apps/README.md) - see my notes on many of the applications I like (which may store their settings in your `~/.config` dir) here.


## Notes

Many/most Linux applications store your persistent, user configuration files and settings inside your `~/.config/` dir. Any application that wishes to, simply creates a dir for itself here and uses it.

Examples: 
1. `~/.config/micro` - settings for the [`micro`](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro) mouse-enabled-CLI text editor
1. `~/.config/subime-text` - settings for the Sublime Text GUI text editor

So, I'll back up some of my `~/.config` settings files I find most important, or which I have customized.
