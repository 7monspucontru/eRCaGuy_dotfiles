# Notes:

**Reminder:** you cannot open up the [.git_editor.sublime-project](.git_editor.sublime-project) file in Sublime Text to edit it as a _text file_. This is because it has a Sublime Text _project file_ extension (`.sublime-project`), so Sublime Text reads it as a _project file_ instead of letting you edit it as a _text file_. To overcome this, simply open it in gedit or some other text editor to edit it as a _text file_.

You can also use `nano` at the command-line:

    nano .git_editor.sublime-project

Or, just to _view_ its contents:

    cat .git_editor.sublime-project
