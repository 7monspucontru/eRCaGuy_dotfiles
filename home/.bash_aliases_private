# >> THIS IS THE PRIMARY BASH CONFIGURATION FILE FOR YOU TO EDIT AND CUSTOMIZE! <<

# INSTALLATION & USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. If you are pulling in my bash configuration files for your usage, I recommend you leave the
#    ".bashrc" and ".bash_aliases" files alone, and copy and edit and customize this
#    ".bash_aliases_private" file instead!
# 2. See the "eRCaGuy_dotfiles/home/README.md" file, with full instructions and details, here:
#    https://github.com/ElectricRCAircraftGuy/eRCaGuy_dotfiles/tree/master/home

# ==================================================================================================
# PERSONAL (PRIVATE) Bash Setup, Variables, Aliases, & Functions
# - Add your personal, custom, or otherwise unshared bash aliases and functions here below.
# - It is recommended to use this file for your personal or private aliases and functions rather
#   than defining them in the "~/.bashrc" or "~/.bash_aliases" file.
# - If you have something you think is very useful to others, add it to the "~/.bash_aliases" file
#   and then open up a Pull Request on GitHub to ask me to merge it into the main eRCaGuy_dotfiles
#   repo.
# - All bash aliases or functions below will override any from the "~/.bash_aliases" file if
#   they have the same name.
# ==================================================================================================

# In my naming of aliases and functions, I like to precede names with my initials followed by an
# underscore, like this: `gs_some_cmd_name`. This way, simply by typing `gs_` at the terminal and
# then pressing Tab twice, I can quickly see a list of ALL of my available custom functions. To
# add your own initials, one technique is to simply add an alias to my aliases, like this. Let's
# assume your initials are "am":
# am_
