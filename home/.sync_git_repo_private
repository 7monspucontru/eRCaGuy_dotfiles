# This file contains custom, private variables and ssh information for you to run the
# "eRCaGuy_dotfiles/useful_scripts/sync_git_repo_from_pc1_to_pc2.sh" script.

# The above script synchronizes a git repository from Personal Computer 1 (PC1) to Personal Computer
# 2 (PC2).

# INSTALLATION:
# See the instructions in "eRCaGuy_dotfiles/useful_scripts/sync_git_repo_from_pc1_to_pc2.sh", as
# well as in the associated README that is mentioned there.


# YOUR PRIVATE INFORMATION:


# Your name. No spaces allowed! Recommended to use all lower-case. This is only used to help create
# the synchronization git branch name.
MY_NAME="first.last"

# The git repo root directory on PC2 where you are syncing your files TO; this dir must *already
# exist* and you must have *already `git clone`d* a copy of your git repo into it!
# Do NOT use variables such as `$HOME`. Be explicit instead. This is because the variable expansion
# will happen on the local machine when what we need is the variable expansion from the remote
# machine. Being explicit instead just avoids this problem.
PC2_GIT_REPO_TARGET_DIR="/home/gabriel/dev/eRCaGuy_dotfiles"

# Target SSH username: explicitly type this out; don't use variables; you may run any one of
# the following commands on your target machine to see your username:
#       who
#       whoami
#       echo $USER
#       echo $USERNAME
# Ex: "gabriel"
PC2_SSH_USERNAME="my_username"
# Target SSH hostname or IP address: explicitly type this out; don't use variables; run the
# `hostname` command on your target machine to see your hostname, or run `ifconfig` to see your IP
# address. Ex: "gabriel-mypc1234", "10.0.0.100", or "192.168.200.100"
PC2_SSH_HOST="my_hostname"
