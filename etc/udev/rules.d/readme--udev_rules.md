# udev rules readme

Linux udev (possibly stands for "USB device") rules are the rules which control the access and configuration of USB devices as they are hot-plugged into or removed from a system. 

- Udev rules should be placed in the "/etc/udev/rules.d" directory. 
- Each rule ends with ".rules".
