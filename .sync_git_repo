# Variables for "eRCaGuy_dotfiles/useful_scripts/sync_git_repo_from_pc1_to_pc2.sh" script

# The above script synchronizes a git repository from Personal Computer 1 (PC1) to Personal Computer 2 (PC2).

# INSTALLATION: 
# 1. Update the variables below with your information. 
# 2. Copy this file to ~/.sync_git_repo:
#       cp -i path/to/eRCaGuy_dotfiles/.sync_git_repo ~/.sync_git_repo
# 3. Ensure all your ssh keys are set up on both PC1 and PC2. This includes A) the keys to push/pull
#    to/from your remote git repos, and B) the keys required to ssh from PC1 into PC2.
# 4. Manually `git clone` your repo onto both PC1 and PC2.
# 5. Now run the sync script whenever you have changes you want to push from PC1 to PC2 for building or 
#    testing!: 
#       eRCaGuy_dotfiles/useful_scripts/sync_git_repo_from_pc1_to_pc2.sh

# The git repo root directory on PC2 where you are syncing your files TO; this dir must *already exist* 
# and you must have *already `git clone`d* a copy of your git repo into it!
# - Do NOT use variables such as `$HOME`. Be explicit instead. This is because the variable expansion will 
#   happen on the local machine when what we need is the variable expansion from the remote machine. Being 
#   explicit instead just avoids this problem.
PC2_GIT_REPO_TARGET_DIR="/home/gabriel/dev/eRCaGuy_dotfiles"

PC2_SSH_USERNAME="my_username" # explicitly type this out; don't use variables
PC2_SSH_HOST="my_hostname"     # explicitly type this out; don't use variables

# Your name. No spaces allowed! Recommended to use all lower-case. This is only used to create the 
# synchronization git branch name just below. 
MY_NAME="gabriel.staples" 

# This is the name of the local and remote branch we will use for git repository synchronization from PC1 to PC2.
# Feel free to modify this as you see fit.
