This is for the [Microsoft Visual Studio Code (MS VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) text editor/IDE. 

The `.vscode` dir should be placed at the root of your workspace (ie: the folder you intend to open up via **File --> Open Folder**).

The `settings.json` file should be copy-pasted into this path: `~/.config/Code/User/settings.json`.


## Common VSCode Extensions/Plugins I like to install

See [.vscode/extensions.json](.vscode/extensions.json) for a list of recommendations. Place the `.vscode` folder into the root of your VSCode workspace. Then, in VSCode, go to the Extensions tab and search for "@recommended". This will search this file for the recommendations therein and bring them all up under the "WORKSPACE RECOMMENDATIONS" search results section. Click the little tiny cloud-looking icon to the right of that heading to "Install Workspace Recommended Extensions" automatically for you!
