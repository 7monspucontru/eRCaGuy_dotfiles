# Sublime Text Settings:

To install the main `Preferences.sublime-settings` file, as well as all other syntax-specific/file-extension-specific `*.sublime-settings` preference files _which override that main preferences file for their respective file types_, simply copy them all to the Sublime Text 3 `/home/$USER/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User/` directory!

# Packages to install

To Install a package:

`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` --> "Package Control: Install Package"

These are the Sublime Text 3 packages I currently have installed and like to have installed:

1. **ANSIescape** - adds a syntax highlighter to escape ANSI color codes like the `less -RFX` command will do too
1. **Compare Side-By-Side** - has nothing on Meld, but works OK for quick side-by-side file comparisons
1. **Git** - I use this almost exclusively for `git blame` inside Sublime; otherwise I'm all about the command-line when it comes to git!
1. **[Package Control]** - comes default with Sublime; you better have this to install more packages
1. **Tabright** - causes all new tabs and files opened at the command-line to show up at the far right/end instead of immediately after the tab you currently have open! This helps a lot for organization, as now tabs automatically get sorted in chronological order as you open them, rather than being a big random conglomeration which is impossible to make sense of and/or go through chronologically.
